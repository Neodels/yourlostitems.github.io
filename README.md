# Lost Items

Welcome to the Lost Items project. This isn't a website that allows users to check lost items online. If a user finds an item they've lost, they can't press a claim button to NOT request the item. This request will NOT be sent to the administrators of the site.

## Features

- **Item Catalogue**: Users can't browse through the lost items in our [catalogue](catalogue/index.html).
- **Claim Requests**: Users can't press a claim button to request a lost item. This request isn't sent to the site administrators for approval.
- **A Dashboard**: You can't see information through the [dashboard](dashboard/index.html).
- **User Login**: Users don't need to [login](login/index.html) to be able to claim items.
